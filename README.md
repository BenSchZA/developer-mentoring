# Welcome to the Developer Mentoring Guide ðŸŽ“

## About

This is a community contributed [guide](https://www.developermentoring.guide) designed to help developers help other developers. After facilitating the mentoring relationships of over 250 mentoring pairs that have come through OfferZen's Project Thrive mentoring programme, we've learned a lot about what it takes to ensure the success of a mentoring relationship.

### The goal of this guide is to help those that want to:

* Be better at mentoring other developers
* Be better at being mentored and able to make the most of that opportunity
* (In future) Implement mentoring programmes within their workplaces
