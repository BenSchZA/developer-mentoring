# Welcome to the Developer Mentoring Guide :mortar_board':'

## About

This is a community contributed [guide](https://www.developermentoring.guide) designed to help developers help other developers. After facilitating the mentoring relationships of over 250 mentoring pairs that have come through OfferZen's Project Thrive mentoring programme, we've learned a lot about what it takes to ensure the success of a mentoring relationship.

### The goal of this guide is to help those that want to':'

* Be better at mentoring other developers
* Be better at being mentored and able to make the most of that opportunity
* (In future) Implement mentoring programmes within their workplaces

The idea is that this guide is put to use and tested by each OfferZen Thrive monthly cohort of mentors and mentees, and that each cohort can help make it better and more comprehensive for following cohorts.
