## **Scenario 4**

> Alice (a mentee) has a mentoring session scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 7pm. However, when the time comes, she doesn’t show. When her mentor contacts her to find out whether they’re still meeting, she tells her mentor that she has a work deadline and asks to reschedule to Thursday evening.
