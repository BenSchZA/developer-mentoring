**Missing ingredient** : None, this sauce is _delicious_!

**Because**: The reason this scenario is delicious is because Ben and his mentor decided to re-evaluate the goals **together** - they were able to adapt to changing circumstances.

Ben and his mentor were **proactive** when it came to **collaborating** to re-prioritise the goals.
