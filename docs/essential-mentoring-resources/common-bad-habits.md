# Common Bad Habits Seen by Senior Developers

**Drop your experiences below! Doesn't matter how messy it looks - we'll clean it up** ðŸ§¹

1) Be patient. Software development can be painstakingly slow and patience and perserverance is a virtue on the path to being a good software developer. A lot of juniors a whole lot of them tend to throw in the towel all too quickly and seek support from seniors.
2) Be inquisitive - Be inquisitive. Ask questions even if they make you sound dumb. Asking questions is a path to building good analytical abilities. And great software is the mind work of strong analytical abilities
3) Give credit where its due - If someone has helped you in getting to the bottom of things then give them due credit. This is all the more important when you work with software teams as giving and receiving credit is the path to excellent team work
4) Learn something new EVERY SINGLE DAY - If a day goes by in your working life where you do not learn something new in your field of work then your path to incremental success diminishes all too quickly. Software stacks come and go at the speed of thought. Its impossible to keep pace with all the learning but its never impossible to have the urge to learn and know more.
5) Get your hands dirty - Most devs tend to lack the enthusiasm to get their hands dirty. Yes be ready to plunge in and get your hands dirty writing and fixing code day in and out. 
6) Be clean write clean - Writing code is easy but writing code which is clean and maintainable in the long run is a skill. Learn and practise the art of writing maintainable code early on in your career. 
7) A picture is worth a thousand words - This adage holds true for software development. If you cannot explain your shitty code to a non technical person using pictures and diagrams (flow charts, activity diagrams, swim lanes) then your job is half done. Highly maintainable software is one which can be understood both from the outside via pictures and from the inside via lines of fluid code.
8) Being soft is not bad - Soft skills matter a lot. Develop your soft skills. If you cannot connect with the human at the other end then your software skills wont create the desired effect.
9) The power of observation - A software developer in plain simple terms is a problem solver. If you train your mind to observe real world problems and find solutions to them, then there is a 99% chance that you will succeed in your career in software development. Adapting your mind to solving problems is what defines the software developer in you.
10) Learn to SWITCH OFF - Life cannot and should not be all about staring and glaring at the computer screen. At the end of the working day learn to swtich off. Leave your work problems at the work desk. Cultivate a hobby. Have a life beyond writing lines of code.
