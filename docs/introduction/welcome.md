## Welcome!

This guide was initially developed by [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) as part of it's Project Thrive intitiative - a mentoring program that has helped over 250 pairs of developers level each other up over the last couple years. Mentors and mentees came from startups through enterprise, from Europe through Africa. You can read more about the projects history in the next section. Through the project, they learned a lot about what makes developer mentoring successful. They open-sourced these learning, resources, and carricula and this guide. 

The guide and initiative is now maintained by members of the community from both within and without of OfferZen. 

## Purpose of this Guide
The purpose of this guide is to provide you with the tips and frameworks to help intitaite and make the most of a developer mentoring relationship.

## How to use this guide
This guide breaks down different aspects of the mentoring relationship. It is centred around single mentor-mentee pairs. It'll outline the expectations of both mentors and mentees and mentoring best practices, as well as provide some helpful frameworks around which to structure the mentoring relationship.&#x20;

Each mentoring relationship is different â€” each pair will set different goals and face different challenges. For this reason, each pair may rely on a different framework to help them structure their mentoring relationship. Our guide is therefore designed to be easy to skim to find the particular information you're looking for, but also to provide depth if you want to learn more about a topic.&#x20;
  
This guide aims to provide **mentors and mentees** with the knowledge and tools to set themselves up for success as they begin their mentoring journey.
