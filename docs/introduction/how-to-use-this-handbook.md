# How to Use this Guide

This guide breaks down different aspects of the mentoring relationship. It'll outline the expectations of both mentors and mentees and mentoring best practices, as well as provide some helpful frameworks around which to structure the mentoring relationship.&#x20;

Each mentoring relationship is different - each pair will set different goals and face different challenges. For this reason, each pair may rely on a different framework to help them structure their mentoring relationship. Our handbook is therefore designed to be easy to skim to find the particular information you're looking for, but also to provide depth if you want to learn more about a  topic.&#x20;
 
The **goal** of this guide is to provide **mentors and mentees** with the knowledge and tools to set themselves up for success as they begin their mentoring journey.
