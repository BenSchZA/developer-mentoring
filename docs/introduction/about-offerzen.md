[OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com) is a developer talent marketplace by developers _for_ developers. Our platform matches top software talent with exciting opportunities at companies, but this effort encompasses a much wider mission: **to help developers and their teams thrive in the tech ecosystem**.

Over the last five years, this mission has manifested in a multitude of ways: from our core business of helping software makers find awesome new jobs, to hosting local maker evenings and tech events or helping makers share their experiences on our blog. We want to help build an inclusive, transparent, and thriving tech ecosystem.
