# Different Types of Mentors
### (And How to Know Which One You Are)

## 1. The Advisor

The Advisor draws on their experience and know-how to steer their mentee in the right direction. This type of mentor is best suited to mentees who hope to pursue a similar career path. **This is a popular mentoring style among Project Thrive mentors.**

## 2. The Protector

The Protector provides support and establishes a safe environment for their mentee. This type of mentor can be overprotective; however, they may be ideal for a mentee in the midst of a career change.

## 3. The Coach

The Coach is able to listen carefully and sympathizes with their mentee. These sorts of skills allow Coaches to easily recognise any difficulties their mentee might be experiencing, while also helping them to identify and strengthen their good traits.

## 4. The Connector

Connectors are always offering their mentees opportunities to grow. They're especially eager to draw on their large networks if it means that their mentee could learn or benefit in a significant way.

## 5. The Challenger

These "tough love" mentors are commited to building up their mentees' problem-solving abilities. They push their mentees in order for them to reach—and even extend—their limits. The mentoring goal of Challengers is to promote their mentees' independence.
