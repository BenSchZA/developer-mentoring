# Different Types of Mentors
### (And How to Know Which One You Are)

## The Advisor

The Advisor draws on their experience and know-how to steer their mentee in the right direction. This type of mentor is best suited to mentees who hope to pursue a similar career path. **This is a popular mentoring style among Project Thrive mentors.**

## The Protector

The Protector provides support and establishes a safe environment for their mentee. This type of mentor can be overprotective, however, they may be ideal for a mentee who is in the midst of a career change.
