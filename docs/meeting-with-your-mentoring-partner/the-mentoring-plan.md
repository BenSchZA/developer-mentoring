This plan is to help set you up for success as you set out on your mentoring journey. We recommend chatting about your expectations of one another, as well as your roles and responsibilities at the beginning of the relationship. When you know this, you’re defining what success looks like upfront, so you can keep moving toward it together. Here are some useful questions to consider:​

## Meeting and Communicating

* **Meetings:**
  * When will you meet? (e.g., `Tuesdays at 4PM`)
  * How will you meet? (e.g., `Zoom`)
  * What happens when there is an unavoidable cancellation? (e.g., inform mentoring partner at least `24 hours` in advance and arrange an alternative date)
* **Communicating between meetings:**
  * How will you communicate in between meetings? (e.g., via `Slack`)
  * When will you share meeting prep notes before the session?
  * Who is in charge of sharing notes and action items after each meeting?
