At [**Project Thrive**](https://www.offerzen.com/thrive), we evaluate the success of a mentoring relationship by how well the pair is incorporating what we’ve dubbed the ['mentoring secret sauce'](https://www.developermentoring.guide/docs/meeting-with-your-mentoring-partner/working-with-mentoring-partner). The secret sauce contains four ‘ingredients’ that we believe are the key components to ensure mentoring success. If any of these four ingredients go ‘off’ (or get left out of the recipe completely), this could lead to the mentoring relationship going sour.

The four key ingredients that make up this secret sauce are:

**1. Collaboration** 🤝

**2. Communication** 💬

**3. Curiosity** 🐱

**4. Proactivity** ⚓️

All of these ingredients are important for both mentors and mentees to incorporate into their relationship in order for the relationship to be a valuable one for both parties.

Project Thrive has seen over 300 pairs go through our tech mentoring programme. Let’s read through some real-life mentoring scenarios that we've encountered to see if you can spot the missing ingredient, or if this sauce is delicious as it should be!
