At [**Project Thrive**](https://www.offerzen.com/thrive), we evaluate the success of a mentoring relationship by how well the pair is incorporating what we‚Äôve dubbed the ['mentoring secret sauce'](https://www.developermentoring.guide/docs/meeting-with-your-mentoring-partner/working-with-mentoring-partner). The secret sauce contains four ‚Äòingredients‚Äô that we believe are the key components to ensure mentoring success. If any of these four ingredients go ‚Äòoff‚Äô (or get left out of the recipe completely), this could lead to the mentoring relationship going sour. The four key ingredients that make up this secret sauce are: 

**1. Collaboration** ü§ù

**2. Communication** üí¨

**3. Curiosity** üê±

**4. Proactivity** ‚öìÔ∏è

All of these ingredients are important for both mentors and mentees to incorporate into their relationship in order for the relationship to be a valuable one for both parties.

Project Thrive has seen over 300 pairs go through our tech mentoring programme. Let‚Äôs read through some real-life mentoring scenarios that we've encountered to see if you can spot the missing ingredient, or if this sauce is delicious as it should be!

## **Scenario 1**

> Lucy (mentee) wants to develop her python skills. Based on this, her mentor develops a lesson plan for Lucy to work through during the mentoring relationship.

Reveal Missing Ingredient...

**Missing ingredient**: Collaboration ü§ù

**Because**: The reason this scenario is missing collaboration is because Lucy‚Äôs mentor developed the plan for her. This implies that they did not collaborate together to develop the plan. In a mentoring relationship, it is very important that the mentee drives the relationship, and so the fact that Lucy was not involved in developing the plan is the main issue.

## **Scenario 2** 

> Ben (mentee) is feeling swamped at work and is struggling to make progress towards his goals. He and his mentor decide to re-evaluate his goals and re-prioritize where necessary. 

Reveal Missing Ingredient...

**Missing ingredient** : None, this sauce is _delicious_!

**Because**: The reason this scenario is delicious is because Ben and his mentor decided to re-evaluate the goals **together** - they were able to adapt to changing circumstances. Sticking with goals that are no longer feasible sets the relationship up for failure. Ben and his mentor **communicated** well with regards to Ben struggling to make progress towards his goal. Ben and his mentor were **proactive** when it came to **collaborating** to re-prioritise the goals.

## **Scenario 3**

> Nick (mentee) is in a tricky situation at work. His mentor has been in a very similar situation before, and tells Nick exactly how to handle it.

Reveal Missing Ingredient...

**Missing ingredient**: Curiosity üê±

**Because**: The reason this scenario is missing curiosity is because mentors should never advise, but rather share their experiences. There is no guarantee that Nick‚Äôs tricky situation is exactly like his mentor‚Äôs. So it would be better for Nick‚Äôs mentor to simply share his experience, ask questions, and then for Nick to decide, based on this newly acquired knowledge, which steps to take next.

## **Scenario 4**

> Alice (mentee) has a mentoring session scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 7pm. However, when the time comes, she doesn‚Äôt show. When her mentor contacts her to find out whether they‚Äôre still meeting, she tells her mentor that she has a work deadline and asks to reschedule to Thursday evening.

Reveal Missing Ingredient...

**Missing ingredient**: Communication and proactivity üí¨ ‚öìÔ∏è

The reason this scenario is missing communication and proactivity is because both mentors and mentees should let their mentoring partner know **in advance** when they are unable to make a mentoring session. Of course, sometimes life happens, and this is not possible - but this should definitely be the exception and not the rule.
