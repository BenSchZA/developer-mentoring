Meeting agendas. For some, theyâ€™re the broccoli of the working world: some people like them, we all know we need them, but they arenâ€™t a favourite ðŸ¥¦

In a mentoring relationship, a meeting agenda is a very good way to focus the session and provides both mentor and mentee with a good insight into what is top of mind for the other person.&#x20;

Depending on what youâ€™ve decided on in your mentoring agreement, maybe youâ€™ll share a meeting agenda the day before your next session, or work on it together at the beginning of the session. Either way, youâ€™ll want to create your agenda before you start your conversation.

### Getting started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

* Decide **who** is responsible for completing the session agenda
* Decide **when** the meeting agenda should be shared with the other person
* Remember, the agenda is here to **help you have a great conversation**. Jot down what makes sense for you.

Keep it in a place where you can both access it easily

### Example of how to structure a session

You're free to run your sessions in any manner that works for you and your mentoring partner. However, if youâ€™re unsure about how to get started, we suggest that you start off running it similarly to how you would a 1:1 meeting with your team lead. This [link](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-ones-employee-know/) provides a good guideline for how to run a 1:1.

These are some good questions to address in each session:

* Personal check-in
* What has gone well in the last week?
* What has not gone well in the last week?
* What are you hoping to accomplish in the coming week?
* What challenges do you anticipate?
