# Example Goals for Mentoring Relationships

Here are some examples of technical, career, and personal goals that participants in the Project Thrive programme set in their mentoring relationships! üöÄ

#### #1: Helping Me Prepare for the AWS Sub-Saharan Challenge

After working with my mentor through a personal SWOT analysis I now have a much clearer idea of the career path ahead of me. And so, I've registered for an AWS course and already have my exam voucher! Over these next few weeks, my mentor will help me prep for the exam and (hopefully) get me closer to an AWS certification ü§û

!!! ERROR !!!

Kidding! After chatting to my mentor about my goals and where my career was heading, we collectively decided that instead of focusing on technical skills we would focus on leadership & soft skills. So naturally, I am in critique wonderland. Yay! 

For the past few weeks I have been working on a "Book Club" where we work through a book called "Dare to Lead" with a few others from the Slack channel. So far it's been a challenging experience but in the most positive way & I am learning a lot from the experience - not only about leadership, but about myself ***queue violin music***. 

I am using many of these new skills in my work & personal life, only up from here (so far, no one has hit me over the head yet so I think it's working).

#### #12: Dealing with Day to day challenges of working in Tech

The tech space is fast-paced and ever challenging environment. For one to reach their career goals one need to deal with certain obstacles that every developer is bound to encounter at some point in their career, one that stands out the most is imposter syndrome.

I often advise my mantee to be aware of his knowledge gaps and understand that we are in a career that you're always in a cycle of continuous learning, that being said it is important to find a method of learning that works for him, it can either writing blogs, giving talks or every creating small github repos which will mean that he actively applies thne concepts his learning. I personally I'm still a student in this industry and prefer problem based knowledge, where by what I learn is often based on the problem I'm trying to solve. I would advise all the mentees to find what works for them.

While continuous learning and application is very important, is rest the worst thing that can happen to a developer is trying to be productive and enjoy what they're doing while burnout, thus rest and doing anything outside of code is very important... in short all of us need to get a hobby and take time off from changing the world through code. Mental block, imposter syndrome and exhaustion is not nice, give yourself a break. 

Lastly:
- break down your goals in small manageable task that can be done quickly (Momentum is key here)
- Your goals: you're accountable to yourself
- Go easy on yourself since we're all learning there's no room for imposter syndrome
- Take time off from code and prioritise you and your family

My Mantee has really suporised me in his execution of the above mentioned and has been making such great progress. I would have been cool to meet hi in person sice we're in different provinces.

#### #29: I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional

My mentor and I used the SMART analysis, which incorporates all of the following criteria, to help focus our efforts and increase the chances of achieving the set goal;
Specific - I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional.
Measurable - I want to use my 12 weeks on Project Thrive to create a stronger skillset (soft skills and technical).
Achievable - I will learn tools to combat overthinking, disorganisation and bottlenecks that may be limiting my productivity.
Realistic - I will implement these strategies on my Kanban Board. The goal is to decrease time-to-completion on my tasks.
Timebound - 12 Weeks: In this period I will revamp my CV, LinkedIn and Portfolio so I can build my network and THRIVE.
