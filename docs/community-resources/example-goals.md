# Example Goals for Mentoring Relationships

Here are some examples of technical, career, and personal goals that participants in the Project Thrive programme set in their mentoring relationships! üöÄ

#### #1: Helping Me Prepare for the AWS Sub-Saharan Challenge

After working with my mentor through a personal SWOT analysis I now have a much clearer idea of the career path ahead of me. And so, I've registered for an AWS course and already have my exam voucher! Over these next few weeks, my mentor will help me prep for the exam and (hopefully) get me closer to an AWS certification ü§û

#### #29: I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional

My mentor and I used the SMART analysis, which incorporates all of the following criteria, to help focus our efforts and increase the chances of achieving the set goal;
Specific - I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional.
Measurable - I want to use my 12 weeks on Project Thrive to create a stronger skillset (soft skills and technical).
Achievable - I will learn tools to combat overthinking, disorganisation and bottlenecks that may be limiting my productivity.
Realistic - I will implement these strategies on my Kanban Board. The goal is to decrease time-to-completion on my tasks.
Timebound - 12 Weeks: In this period I will revamp my CV, LinkedIn and Portfolio so I can build my network and THRIVE.
