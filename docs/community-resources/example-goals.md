# Example Goals for Mentoring Relationships

Here are some examples of technical, career, and personal goals that participants in the Project Thrive programme set in their mentoring relationships! üöÄ

#### #1: Helping Me Prepare for the AWS Sub-Saharan Challenge

After working with my mentor through a personal SWOT analysis I now have a much clearer idea of the career path ahead of me. And so, I've registered for an AWS course and already have my exam voucher! Over these next few weeks, my mentor will help me prep for the exam and (hopefully) get me closer to an AWS certification ü§û

!!! ERROR !!!

Kidding! After chatting to my mentor about my goals and where my career was heading, we collectively decided that instead of focusing on technical skills we would focus on leadership & soft skills. So naturally, I am in critique wonderland. Yay! 

For the past few weeks I have been working on a "Book Club" where we work through a book called "Dare to Lead" with a few others from the Slack channel. So far it's been a challenging experience but in the most positive way & I am learning a lot from the experience - not only about leadership, but about myself ***queue violin music***. 

I am using many of these new skills in my work & personal life, only up from here (so far, no one has hit me over the head yet so I think it's working).

#### #12: Dealing With The Day-to-Day Challenges of Working in Tech

The tech space is a fast-paced and challenging environment. For someone to reach their career goals, they need to deal with certain obstacles that every developer is bound to encounter at some point in their career. One that stands out the most is **imposter syndrome**.

I often advise my mentee to be aware of his knowledge gaps and to understand that he's in a career where everyobody is always in a cycle of continuous learning. That said, it's important to find a method of learning that works for him. This could be blog wriitng, giving talks, or even creating small GitHub repos‚Äîall these methods involve him actively applying the concepts he's learned. Even as a mentor I still consider myself a learner in this industry and prefer problem-based knowledge where whatever I learn is based on the problem I'm trying to solve. But I would advise any mentees to find what works for them.

While I think continuous learning and application is important, I'm aware that the worst thing that can happen to a developer is trying to be _overly_ productive to the point where they burnout. Never deprioritise sleep or rest. Doing things outside of the code is also important! Everyone needs a hobby or a way to take time off from changing the world through code. Mental exhausation is never fun or rewarding. Give yourself a break.

If I had to sum up my advice:
- Break down your goals into small, manageable tasks that can be done quickly (momentum is key here)
- Find a way to be accountable for your goals
- Go easy on yourself; we're all learning
- Take time off from code and prioritise your health and family

My mentee has made such great progress and really suprised me in his how well he executed the above recommendations. It would have been great to meet him in person (our mentoring relationship was virtual since we were in different provinces).

#### #29: I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional

My mentor and I used the SMART analysis, which incorporates all of the following criteria, to help focus our efforts and increase the chances of achieving the set goal;
Specific - I want to be working at an intermediate level as a Front-End Developer and professional.
Measurable - I want to use my 12 weeks on Project Thrive to create a stronger skillset (soft skills and technical).
Achievable - I will learn tools to combat overthinking, disorganisation and bottlenecks that may be limiting my productivity.
Realistic - I will implement these strategies on my Kanban Board. The goal is to decrease time-to-completion on my tasks.
Timebound - 12 Weeks: In this period I will revamp my CV, LinkedIn and Portfolio so I can build my network and THRIVE.
