Easily one of the most widely-revered programming books, **The Pragmatic Programmer** not only engages with a broad range of programming and software engineering topics but also touches on aspects of career development and personal responsibility. Sidestepping the traditional theoretical approach in favour of thoughtful analogies, clever examples, and amusing anecdotes, the book manages to impart the general principles of good programming in a unique and entertaining narrative style.
